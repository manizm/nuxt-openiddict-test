# Nuxt & Openiddict test 

### Startup
- install client modules: `cd client && npm install`
- To start client run: `cd client && npm run dev`
- To start server run: `cd server/OpeniddictServer && dotnet run .`
  - You would have to most probably run and accept dev-certs from .net
  - running dotnet should automatically install all the dependencies and run required migrations
